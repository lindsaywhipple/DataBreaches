# ANALYSIS
#==========

# Within these three years, the total number of individuals affected by healthcare-related data breaches varied significantly. 
# 2024 saw a large spike in the total number of indivduals affected, most likely driven by some extremely large data breaches including, Change Healthcare, Inc. (190 million) anf Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. (13.4 million).
# There appears to be high skewness in the data caused by massive outliers which is shown by the median in contrast to the mean. 

# The top one percent of data breaches alone account for a majority of all indviduals affected in this time span. 
# These breaches include Change Healthcare, Inc. (2024, 190 million), Kaiser Foundation (2024, 13.4 million), HCA Healthcare (2023, 11.2 million), Ascension Health (2024, 5.4 million), and Yale New Haven (2025, 5.5 million).
