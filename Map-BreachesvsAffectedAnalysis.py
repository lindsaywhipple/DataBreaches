#==========
# ANALYSIS
#==========

# This interactive map is exploring the geographic dimension of breach incidents, allowing users to toggle between Breach Count and Total Indivduals Affected for each US state (with readily available data).
# Texas, New York, and California report the highest number of data breaches, at 72, 57, and 54 respectively. 
# Minnesota has over 190 million indivduals affected, which was driven by a small number of high-severity data breaches. 
# My correlation analysis shows a weak relationship (r = 0.14) between breach count and total affected per state, indicating that breach volume is not a reliable predictor of breach severity. 
# These four mentioned states, along with Illinois, all appear to be statistical outliers.
# Minnesota has a breach count of 19, but high impact due to a few massive incidents, resulting in a Z-score of 6.67.
# California, Texas, and New York all have significantly above-average breach counts, with Z-Scores > 2.3, but a bit less extreme in individuals affected.
# Illinois, has a high breach count of 52 without a corresponding high impact, making it an interesting outlier in the opposite direction.
